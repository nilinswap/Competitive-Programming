.........And another day is nearing its end. I had a nice day today as I played and enjoyed basketball but unfortunately could't play football but I soon will. There were small sessions of piano here and there and I am learning it quickly and I hope I will learn fur elise fully in a week or so and become fluent within a month. This will be a major confidence booster for me and I hope it will be a nice beginning to a never ending partnership with the world of emotions and their expression in one of the most robust way there is:Music.
Then I had sought to think over what were good moments today and when I was happy and when was I not and thus I will realize that the day was actually positive. But since I want to participate in virtual contest, I will postpone this for tomorrow. I have started learning C++ and hopefully will complete it within a day or two. So I think today was nice and I tried to keep it ideal and productive. Tomorrow I will talk to Somi didi for sure. And before closing, I read the chats with which I and Shrushti started and they sure have a lesson or two between them and I want to review them. I am also considering my entries when its the right time.
Baki to ab apne dum pe jeet ke dikhana hai. I want to live life to the full and enjoy as much as possible. Self-awareness has always been and should always be the key. Also I will rethink on the game theory on girls. Bye. VAMOS!!!!!!!
