# Competitive-Programming

This repo is basic reflection of all the resources on CP that I have come across till yet as well as all the programs I wrote alongwith other interesting programs.

The organisation of the repo is such that all the contest programs have been placed inside the directory named by the online platform of the contest. Further there is a collection of the assignments I recieved at my college(IIIT-H) as a part of prgramming and Algorithm courses. Also there is a separate file containing my a collection of the interesting problems I have come across.

The will be another directory with files related to my personal experiences from the contests and other #GoToEssentials that I have found to be important and worth remembering for CP and otherwise too. This part too will be visible to everyone but is mostly intended for my own good.

No restraining now. Go ahead and dive into the joy of CP. Hope my resources help. Happy Coding!
